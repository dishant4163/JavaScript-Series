# JavaScript & classes

<!-- Pt. to Ponder -->

1. Does JS have classes?

    -> No, technically there is no classes in JS till date.

    -> Classes feature was introduced with ECMAScript 2015 specification (referred to as ES6). However, imp. to note that JS primarily a prototype-based language.

    -> Its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over.
