# JavaScript-Series
This repository is dedicated to my JavaScript learning journey with the Chai aur Code YouTube channel. Here, I regularly upload and update the code and projects I work on, ranging from basic to advanced JavaScript concepts. The repository serves as a record of my progress, showcasing practical implementations from each lesson.
