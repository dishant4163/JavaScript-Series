// Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)







/* Notes on 'iiFE'

 > What is an IIFE?
 > Definition: An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.


  # Key Uses of IIFEs
  i). Scope Isolation:- Creates a new scope to avoid variable collisions
  ii). Encapsulation:- Keeps variables private, preventing them from being accessed from outside.
  iii). Avoiding Global Variables:- Helps prevent adding unnecessary variables to the global scope.
  iv). Module Pattern:- Often used to create modules that bundle related code and functionality.
  v). Initialization Code:- Useful for running setup code without affecting the global environment.
