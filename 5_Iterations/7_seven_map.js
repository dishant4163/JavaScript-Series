// Map in JS

const myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

const newNums = myNumbers.map( (num) => num + 10)


console.log(newNums);





/* NOTES

 1. map bhi callbackfn hai in js.

 2. personal pov, it is better than forEach

 3. good pt. is that it returns th values

 4. it can be stored in variables too.
